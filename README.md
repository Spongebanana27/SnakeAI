# SnakeAI

I wanted to expand upon what I learned by reading the textbook Grokking Deep Learning into an area that really interests me: Evolution. Before beginning this project I had zero knowledge of evolutionary algorithms, and I went in blind.

SnakeBot is a class that uses a nonlinear neural network with two hidden layers to play snake. To train snakebot, I used my evolutionary algorithm that was built over the course of a couple months through lots and lots of trial and error. Currently, SnakeBot is pretty dumb. At most it learns that it can score well just by surviving a while, avoiding walls.
